# 🌐 Web Dashboard Integration - Complete Guide

## What This Feature Does

Web users can also be managed from Telegram's Email Management panel. The
shared flow identifies them with `web_<id>`, stores assignments in the Web
assignment table, and supports the same expiry, cancellation, duplicate
confirmation, renewal, removal, replacement, and expiry-edit operations as
Telegram users. Duplicate detection is global across both stores. Web-only
accounts have no required Telegram notification channel, so notification
failure or absence is safe.

When users are **approved on the Telegram bot**, they **automatically get web dashboard access** with:
- ✅ Auto-generated username & password
- ✅ Instant access to view their assigned emails
- ✅ Real-time sync between Telegram bot and web dashboard
- ✅ Calendar view of email expiry dates
- ✅ Change password and profile settings

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

```
User: /start
Bot: Shows approval request button
User: Clicks "Request Access"
Admin: Gets notification
```

### 2️⃣ Admin Approves User

```
Admin: Clicks "Approve" button
Bot: Creates user account in bot

## 👨‍💼 For Admins - Account Management

The system has two separate management areas. Use the area that matches the
account type; Web-only accounts are not shown in Telegram **User Management**.

### Telegram admin panel

**💫 User Management:**
- Lists visible Telegram users (approved and pending)
- Manage Telegram approval, permissions, and Telegram-user email access

**📧 Email Management:**
- Lists Telegram users whose email assignments you can manage
- Assign, remove, replace, and update expiry dates for Telegram-user emails

### Web account management

**🌐 Web manage (Super Admin only):**
- Lists linked and Web-only accounts, including pending accounts
- Approve or set a Web account pending
- Grant or revoke Web permissions
- Open **Manage Emails** for that Web account

**Web-user email operations:**
- Add or remove assigned emails
- Edit email expiry dates
- These operations remain under **🌐 Web manage**, not Telegram **📧 Email Management**

The web dashboard also has browser-based `/users` and **Email Management**
pages for administrators. Those pages are separate from the Telegram admin
menu labels above and may be used for the web dashboard's administrative view.

### Create Backup
**"Settings" Page (Admin Only):**
- Backup all data
- Download backup file
- Restore from backup

---

## 🔗 Linking Telegram and Web

### How They're Connected
```
Telegram Bot          Web Users DB
────────────          ────────────
APPROVED_USERS ───→   web_users table
  └─ user_id    └──→  telegram_id

Telegram approval synchronization can create or approve the linked Web account,
but Web-only accounts are managed separately through **🌐 Web manage**. A Web
account's email assignments are stored in the Web-user assignment store and are
not part of the Telegram-user list in **💫 User Management**.
  └─ name       └──→  full_name
  └─ perms      └──→  role

Same Data Source:
USER_EMAIL_ASSIGNMENTS (used by both)
RENEWAL_DECISIONS (used by both)
```

### Data Flow
```
1. User approved on Telegram
   ↓
2. Web account auto-created with telegram_id
   ↓
3. User logs in with username/password
   ↓
4. Web dashboard uses telegram_id to fetch their emails
   ↓
5. Both Telegram and web show same email list
```
