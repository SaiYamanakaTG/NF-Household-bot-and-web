# Unified admin email flow

Open Telegram **Admin → Email Management** to assign or manage either backend.
Select a numeric Telegram user or a Web target such as `web_4`. Assignment,
expiry, renewal, removal, replacement, cancellation, and duplicate confirmation
use the selected backend; duplicate warnings include both Telegram and Web
owners through cross-backend duplicate detection. Only the super-admin can
manage Web-only accounts.
